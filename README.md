# Implementing-Directory-Search-using-Greedy-and-Dynamic-Technique

This repository contains implementations of directory search algorithms using two distinct approaches: Greedy and Dynamic Programming. These algorithms are designed to solve optimization problems where the goal is to find an optimal path or selection within a directory structure.

Overview
Greedy Algorithm
The Greedy algorithm is an approach that makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. It is simple and intuitive, but it does not always produce the best solution for every problem. In the context of directory search, the greedy algorithm makes decisions based on immediate benefits without considering the overall structure of the directory.

Dynamic Programming
The Dynamic Programming (DP) approach, on the other hand, solves problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. This method is more complex and computationally intensive than the greedy approach, but it guarantees finding the optimal solution by considering all possible choices and their consequences.

Implementation Details
Greedy Algorithm
Concept: At each step, choose the option that looks the best at that moment.
Advantages: Simple to implement and fast.
Disadvantages: May not produce the optimal solution in all cases.
Dynamic Programming
Concept: Break down the problem into smaller subproblems, solve each subproblem, and store their results. Combine the results to solve the original problem.
Advantages: Guarantees finding the optimal solution.
Disadvantages: More complex and may require more memory and computational power.
